getting-cleaning-data-project
=============================

Description of the repo:

The repo contains:

* The R script "run_analysis.R"
* The code book "codebook.md"
* The "UCI HAR Dataset" directory that contains the raw dataset
* The " UCI-HAR-Dataset.zip" file which is a compressed version of the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory.
* The txt-file "tidy_data.txt". 
* This Readme-file


The output of running "run_analysis.R" is the datafile "tidy_data.txt". The script downloads and unzips the raw data-files if they are not present, and creates the output file. No other R scripts are required for the analysis.
The exact manipulations of the data performed by the R script and the description of the dataset can be found in the code book.
